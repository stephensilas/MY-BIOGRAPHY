  <h1>About Myself</h1>
  <h3>My name is Stephen Silas Ebubechikodinaka, but most people call me (ODINAKA)
    I am 27 years old, born on the 2nd of may 1997, i went to staff school at UI IBADAN
    i finished my secondary school 2017, and that same year i wrote my jamb and post jamb 
    that same year and gain admission into polytechnic of ibadan, iknow you seeing IBADAN
    will want to make you feel maybe am an indigene of ibadan, well i dont think so cause 
    my name is not that of the yorubas which i know must of you, must have been aware of,
    the thing is that my dad work in the university of ibadan, he is a member of the SSANU 
    ( senior staff association of nigerian universities), and he died 2005, after he's death, 
    my mom decided to use his pension and gratuity to build a house in ibadan, so that how ibadan 
    became our base after finishing secondary school and also getting my admission that same year 
    into poly-ibadan, things became rough and my schooling became inconvenience for me and also
    for my mom, she could not cope anymore and me though at first i thougth i could rough it a little bit
    but it get to a stage i became the center of focus, it became obvious to everyone that i was having a 
    tough time which i hate the most, hardship i could endure, but the shame? i could not i told my mom 
    i cant cope anymore,  and she said theres nothing she could do because she dosent have money, then
    i was forced to tell her that if money would be the issue, then i would have to go and work and earn
    money, then i dropped out and plan to raise a better capital to finance my schooling, 
    then as i secured a job for myself, i found out that working for someone is like enslaving one self, 
    and that most of this boss dont want the progress of thier employee, rather what they want is for thier
    employees to be serving them all day long, with little compensation, and that what actually prompt me 
    to going into wed-development, i later found out that the small pay one is recieving as an employee,
    wont even be enough for one to live thier basic foundamental lives eig paying bills, house rent, and
     getting food stuff not talkless of planning for the future especially for someone like  me who want to
     save money to go to school, one wont even be given the time to do such things, if one is working under 
     an employer, and that why i decided to be the boss of myself, by becoming a developer.
